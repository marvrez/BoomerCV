BoomerCV is a minimalistic collection of computer vision algorithms, made with simplicity, speed, and boomers in mind.

Setup and usage guides are for zoomers, but just in case...

## Installation

```sh
  git clone git@github.com:marvrez/BoomerCV.git
  cd BoomerCV/
  make -j
```

If any errors show up, it really do be like that sometimes. Otherwise everything should be working, but you should, just in case, check the next section.

## Usage
BoomerCV comes with some cool examples.
You can run them by executing the following command
```sh
  ./boomercv <function>
```

Where `<function>` is currently one of

* `grayscale` - grayscale a given input image
* `resize` - resize a given input image
* `binarize` - binarize a given input image

More instructions will be shown about these functions if you run them without any additional parameters.
